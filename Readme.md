## Nodejs template

This is a templare made using express, typeorm and typescript. In this template i have implemented a validation pipe and authmiddleware.

## Installation

```
git clone
yarn
```

## Usage

I have already made an endpoint which uses the validation pipe and auth middleware.

```
1. http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login
2. http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register
```

These end points uses the validation pipes

```
1. http://localhost:3000/api/user
```

This end point uses the authmiddleware

In future I will be adding RBAC too.
